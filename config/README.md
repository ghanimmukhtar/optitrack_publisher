# Calibration matrix

The calibration matrix is the transformation matrix between the optitrack coordinate system (/optitrack_frame) and the ROS coordinate system (world frame e.g. base_link, base, map, ...)
To calibrate please use the dedicated python notebook in the notebooks/ folder:

```
cd optitrack_publisher/notebooks
ipython notebook
```
